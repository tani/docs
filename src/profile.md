## Profile

TANIGUCHI Masaya is a second-year Ph.D. student in Tojo laboratory, Graduate School of Advanced Science and Technology, Japan Advanced Institute of Science and Technology. His supervisor is Satoshi Tojo. He did a Bachelor of Science in Mathematics at Gakushuin University, and did a Master of Science in Information Science at Japan Advanced Institute of Science and Technology. His research interests lie in the area of formal semantics of natural language, and programming language.
